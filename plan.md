Below is a detailed plan for implementing a modern, interactive gaming app (a “Stack Game”) integrated into your existing Next.js project. This plan covers all dependent files, step-by-step changes, error handling, and best practices:

---

**1. Overall Structure & Feature Set**  
- We will build a “Stack Game” where players time the placement of moving blocks to build a high tower.  
- The game includes animated block movement, score tracking, game-over detection, and a restart option.  
- The UI will be modern and minimalist, using Tailwind CSS with clear typography, spacing, and layout (no external icon libraries or images).  
- The game page will be routed at “/games/stack” and integrated into your Next.js app via client components.

---

**2. Files to Create/Modify**  

- **src/app/layout.tsx** (new file)  
  - This file provides the global layout for your app if it does not exist.
  
- **src/app/games/stack/page.tsx** (new file)  
  - A Next.js route for the game page.
  
- **src/components/games/StackGame.tsx** (new file)  
  - Contains all game logic, animations, state management, and UI for the Stack Game.

- **src/app/globals.css** (modify if necessary)  
  - Add or adjust Tailwind CSS classes and custom styles relevant for the gaming UI.

**3. Step-by-Step Outline**

### A. Create/Update Global Layout (src/app/layout.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Provide a consistent app structure with a header and navigation.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Create a new file `src/app/layout.tsx`.  
  2. Set up a basic HTML structure using standard `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.  
  3. Add a header with simple textual navigation (e.g., “Home”, “Games”) using only typography and spacing.  
  4. Wrap children components within a main container for consistent styling.  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Use try/catch if any asynchronous operation is performed.  
  - Ensure fallback content for missing children elements.

### B. Create the Game Page (src/app/games/stack/page.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Serve as the route for the Stack Game, importing the game component.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Create a new file `src/app/games/stack/page.tsx` and mark it as a client component by placing `"use client"` at the top.  
  2. Import the `StackGame` component from `src/components/games/StackGame.tsx`.  
  3. Design the page with a modern header (e.g., “Stack Game”) and include a styled container for the game.  
  4. Optionally add a text-based button/link to return to the home page.  
- **UI/UX Considerations:**  
  - Use Tailwind classes for margins, padding, and typography.  
  - Ensure a responsive layout that scales on various devices.

### C. Develop the Game Component (src/components/games/StackGame.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Encapsulate the game logic and UI for the interactive Stack Game.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Create a new file `src/components/games/StackGame.tsx` with the `"use client"` directive.  
  2. Define a TypeScript interface for a Block (e.g., `{ x: number; width: number; color: string }`).  
  3. Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) to manage:  
  - An array of placed blocks,  
  - The current moving block (its x-position, width, and styling),  
  - Movement direction and speed,  
  - Score, game-started, and game-over flags.
  4. Implement animation by setting up a `setInterval` inside a useEffect that advances the block position.  
  5. On a user action (e.g., button click or key press), “freeze” the current block:  
  - Check alignment with the block below,  
  - Update the score if aligned, or set game over if misaligned.  
  6. Provide a reset function to restart the game by reinitializing game state.  
  7. Render the game board as a div container with a fixed width and height. Each block is a styled div using Tailwind CSS (e.g., dark backgrounds with white outlines).  
  8. Add error boundaries within the component or wrap it in an error boundary higher in the app to catch unexpected errors.  
- **Error Handling & Best Practices:**  
  - Always clear intervals during component unmount using the cleanup function in useEffect.  
  - Validate state transitions and use TypeScript types to catch issues early.  
  - Provide fallback UI (e.g., an error message and a restart button) if the game state becomes inconsistent.

---

### D. Update globals.css (src/app/globals.css)
- **Purpose:** Enhance the styling for the gaming interface if existing styles are insufficient.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Add custom CSS classes for the game container (e.g., centering content, setting background colors).  
  2. Ensure the fonts, colors, and spacing follow a modern, minimalist design.  
  3. Use Tailwind utilities where possible and document any added CSS rules.
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Use responsive design classes to maintain layout integrity on smaller screens.

---

**4. Integration & Testing**  
- Integrate the new game page into the routing system of Next.js using file-based routing.  
- Run the Next.js development server and navigate to `/games/stack` to test the game.  
- Validate that the block animation, score updates, game over detection, and restart functionality work as expected.  
- Ensure all side effects (setInterval) are properly cleaned up on component unmount.  
- Use browser developer tools to verify responsive design and error logs for any runtime issues.

---

**Summary**  
- Create a global layout (src/app/layout.tsx) to ensure consistent navigation.  
- Develop a client-side game page (src/app/games/stack/page.tsx) that displays the Stack Game.  
- Build the StackGame component (src/components/games/StackGame.tsx) with state-driven animations, block collision checks, score tracking, and restart functionality.  
- Modify globals.css if needed to enhance the modern, minimalist UI design using Tailwind CSS.  
- Follow best practices in React including cleanup functions, proper error handling, and TypeScript typing for a robust implementation.
